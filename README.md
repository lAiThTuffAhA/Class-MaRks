Many school systems use certain techniques to enter students' grades, so I developed a program using the Python language to enter students' grades in a pre-designed excel file. When the program starts, the user enters the grades of the students in the class in the pre-prepared order for the names from the excel file, and then performs the same process on the other subject and so on in succession until he finishes entering all the grades in the section, then the program calculates the average of each student and displays the name of the first student on the section with Modify it and send an alert message to him that the new excel file is ready and he can download it. The project was simple and included only three subjects and 10 students, but if we want to add more subjects or increase the number of students, the process is simple, we only add some modifications to the code
